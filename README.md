# R Statistical Project: 

In this workbook I play with some statistical methods to solve some easy problems: 

**Task 1:** Optimization of continuous function
Finding the maximum of a complex function by steepest ascent algorithm(aka gradien descent) with backtracking.

**Task 2:** Optimization of discrete function
- Selecting a best subset of regressors to explain a sale price for houses with the help of a linear model. 
- Reason: There are 61 predictors and we try to eliminate unrelated variables out of model by
- Method: changes in 1-neighborhood algorithm, we can also apply for complex method like simulated annealing or genetic algorithm.
- Note: For this task we can also other method like Shrikn

- **Task 3:** Perform Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate matter of interest.

I include R-notebook and html notebook. Please head to https://htmlpreview.github.io/ and paste html link to see the preview.

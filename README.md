- Task 1: Finding the maximum of a complex function by steepest ascent algorithm.
- Task 2: Selecting a best subset of regressors to explain a sale price for houses with the help of a linear model. 
Reason: There are 61 indepentdent variables and we try to eliminate unrelated variables out of model by using changes in 1-neighborhood algorithm. 
- Task 3: Estimating matter of interests by Monte Carlo algorithm.

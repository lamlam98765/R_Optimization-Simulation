# R Statistical Project: 

In this workbook I play with some statistical methods to solve some easy problems: 

**Task 1:** Optimization of continuous function
Finding the maximum of a complex function by steepest ascent algorithm (aka gradien descent) with backtracking.

**Task 2:** Optimization of discrete function
- Selecting a best subset of regressors to explain a sale price for houses, meaning we try to eliminate unrelated variables out of model.
- Method: changes in 1-neighborhood algorithm, systematically changes the neighborhood in two phases: firstly, descent to find a local optimum and second phase is to get out of the corresponding valley by changing 1 predictor.
- Note: For this task we can also other methods like Shrinking method (Ridge, Lasso) or Machine Learning model.
- For discrete optimization we can apply more complex method like simulated annealing or genetic algorithm.

**Task 3:** Perform Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate matter of interest.

I include R-notebook and html notebook. Please head to https://htmlpreview.github.io/ and paste html link to see the preview.
